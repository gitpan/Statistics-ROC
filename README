Statistics-ROC version 0.04
===========================

ROC.pm - A Perl module implementing receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC)
           curves with nonparametric confidence bounds

  This code implements a method for constructing nonparametric confidence
  for ROC curves described in     
        R.A. Hilgers, Distribution-Free Confidence Bounds for ROC Curves, 
        Meth Inform Med 1991; 30:96-101
  Additionally some auxilliary functions were ported (and corrected) from 
  Fortran (Applied Statistics, ACM).
  
  A graphical userinterface for drawing and printing these ROC curves is 
  supplied with the module (roc_ui.pl).
  Start with:
	perl roc_ui.pl
  For a user interface test load "ss_7pkt.dat".
  
The module has not changed (apart from the email address update) in comparison to previous versions. The user interface has though (works now with Tk804).
 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

The user interface requires these other modules and libraries:

  Tk
  Tk::DialogBox
