  ROC.pm - A Perl module implementing receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC)
           curves with nonparametric confidence bounds

  This code implements a method for constructing nonparametric confidence
  for ROC curves described in     
        R.A. Hilgers, Distribution-Free Confidence Bounds for ROC Curves, 
        Meth Inform Med 1991; 30:96-101
  Additionally some auxilliary functions were ported (and corrected) from 
  Fortran (Applied Statistics, ACM).

  
  A graphical userinterface for drawing and printing these ROC curves is 
  supplied with the module (roc_ui.pl).
